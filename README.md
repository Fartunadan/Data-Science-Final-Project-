# Data-Science-Final-Project: Predincting Rent Burden in Florida

## Authors: Fartun Adan, Kaela Girod, Daija Yisrael 

## Objective: To determine whether we can develop a model that adequately predicts a household's rent burden status using socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and to learn which variables are the most important in predicting the extent to which a household is rent burdened.

### final_project_cleaning.qmd: This quarto file includes the data cleaning steps of the ACS extracted data to prepare our sample for predictive modeling. 
### final_project.qmd: This quarto file includes the code for each predictive model to predict rent-burden in Flordida using 2023 ACS data. Model 1 is a decision tree with a binary rent-burden variable. Model 2 is a decision tree with a three level factor rent-burden variable (rent burdened, not rent burdened, extremely rent burdened). Model 3 is an elastic net with factor variables.
